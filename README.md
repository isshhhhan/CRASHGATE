# 🏎️ Crashgate: F1 Crash Impact Analysis

**Inspired by Lando Norris’ crash at the Canadian GP**, this data project investigates how in-season crashes have affected Formula 1 drivers' championship standings.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

To analyze:
- Which drivers crashed during races
- What was their standing in the championship *before* the crash
- How they finished the season
- How many places they dropped in standings
- Who won the title that year

---

## 📁 Dataset

Sourced from a [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020],
 merged and cleaned using Python and Pandas.

**Final output:** `crashgate.csv` containing:
- `driver_name`
- `year`
- `round`
- `pre_crash_position`
- `standing_drop`
- `final_position`
- `champion_driver`

---

## ⚙️ Tools Used

- Python (Pandas)
- Google Colab
- CSV manipulation
- GitHub (for version control)

---

## 🧠 Key Skills Practiced

- `merge()` with suffix handling
- Grouping and aggregating data by race & driver
- Time-based analysis using `round` and `year`
- Dataset cleanup and feature selection

---

## 📊 Future Work

- Data visualization (e.g., heatmaps of crash vs. drop)
- Look into wet-weather crashes, pit stop undercuts
- Extend analysis to constructor championship effects

---

## 🚀 Motivation

This project was born out of my passion for Formula 1 and Data Science. I’ve always been curious — when drivers leading a championship crash mid-season, how badly does it hurt their title run?

Now I can answer that with **real data**.
